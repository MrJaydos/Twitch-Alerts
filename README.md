# Twitch Alerts

A modern, self-hostable **Twitch stream alerts overlay** for OBS — Sub, Resub,
Gifted Sub, Cheer/Bits, Raid, and Follow alerts, with a settings dashboard and
one-click test buttons.

This is a ground-up recreation of the alerts portion of the old
[LachhhTools](https://github.com/Lachhh/LachhhTools) (`TwitchGiveawayTool`),
which was an Adobe Flash / ActionScript 3 app. Flash reached end-of-life in
2020 and several services LachhhTools depended on (GameWisp, StreamTip,
PlayerIO) have shut down, so the original can't run today. This rebuild keeps
the useful, still-possible part — the alerts overlay — as a small web app.

### The gifted-sub fix

The original read Twitch IRC `USERNOTICE` messages but only handled
`msg-id=sub` and `msg-id=resub` — it had **no branch for gifted subs**
(`subgift`, `submysterygift`, `anonsubgift`), so gifted subs never triggered an
alert. This version treats gifted subs as first-class events, and by default
renders them with the **same styling as a normal subscriber alert** (the
`Gifted subs use the Subscriber alert style` toggle, on by default) — the way
you remembered it was meant to work. Turn the toggle off to give gifts their
own look.

## Two overlays

There are two Browser Source overlays; use whichever you like (the server drives
both from the same Twitch events):

- **`/widget.html` — the original animations (authentic).** This runs the *real*
  LachhhTools widget (`lachhhWidget.swf`) in [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs) (an
  open-source Flash emulator, bundled — no Flash Player needed) and feeds it your
  live events over the original tool's socket protocol. You get the genuine
  article: the red "SUBSCRIBER LVL UP!" boxing-glove punch (into a full-screen
  "MRJAYDOS" blood-splatter name reveal), the cheer cash-blast with monsters,
  the rock-hands host/raid, original fonts and sounds. It renders on a **green
  background** — add an OBS **Chroma Key** filter (key colour green). The
  widget's own persistent chrome (donation bars, totals, song, ads, news) is
  auto-masked while idle so **only the alerts show**, and the masks drop during
  an alert so nothing is clipped.
- **`/overlay.html` — the modern recreation.** A transparent CSS/SVG overlay
  (no chroma key needed), fully configurable per alert (text, colours, sounds,
  TTS, styles). Good if you want a clean, tweakable look rather than the exact
  original.

Both are shown with copy buttons on the settings page.

## Alert types

| Type | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Subscriber | Twitch chat (`USERNOTICE msg-id=sub`) | New subs |
| Resub | `msg-id=resub` | Shows cumulative months + streak |
| Gifted Sub | `msg-id=subgift` / `anonsubgift` | Uses the Sub style by default |
| Gift Bomb | `msg-id=submysterygift` | Mass community gifts |
| Cheer / Bits | chat message with a `bits` tag | |
| Raid | `msg-id=raid` | Incoming raids + viewer count |
| Follow | *EventSub (optional)* | See "Follow alerts" below |

Subs, resubs, gifts, cheers and raids need **no login** — the app reads your
channel's chat anonymously.

## Run it locally (streaming PC)

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then:

1. Open **http://localhost:3000/** — the settings page. Enter your Twitch
   channel name and click **Save**. The status pill should read
   `connected to #yourchannel`.
2. In OBS, add a **Browser Source** pointing to
   **http://localhost:3000/overlay.html** — set it to 1920×1080.
3. Back on the settings page, click any **Test** button to preview an alert in
   OBS and position it.

## Deploy on Coolify (or any Docker host)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Coolify:** create a new resource from this Git repo. Coolify will build the
  `Dockerfile`. Expose port `3000`, and add a persistent volume mounted at
  `/data` so your settings survive restarts (config is written to
  `/data/config.json` via the `CONFIG_PATH` env var). Optionally set
  `TWITCH_CHANNEL` to pre-fill your channel. **Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD`** to
  protect the dashboard (see below).
- **Plain Docker:**

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```

Then point your OBS Browser Source at
`https://your-domain/overlay.html`.

## Alert styles

Each alert type has its own animation, set per type on the settings page. The
styles recreate the *choreography* of the original LachhhTools on-stream alerts
(read from the widget source in `platform/xSplitWidget`). The original's custom
cartoon art lived in a compiled widget SWF that isn't in the repo, so emoji/CSS
stand-ins carry the same motion and beats:

- **Punch** *(subs, resubs, gifts)* — full-screen takeover: flash + sunburst,
  a doors nameplate that frames the name, a hard "punch" impact with screen
  shake, and a subtitle (tier / "N MONTHS" / gifter). Mirrors `UI_NewSubAnim`
  (centered `punchMc`/`doorsMc` + sound).
- **Pop** *(follows)* — a quick centered badge pop with the name. Mirrors
  `UI_NewFollowerAnim` (centered, name-only, sound).
- **Cannon** *(cheers)* — a monster rises bottom-right and a cannon fires a
  cash bag arcing across the screen, with the cheerer's name + bits. Mirrors
  `UI_NewCheerAnim` (bottom-right `FxMonster` + `FxCheerBag` fired at frame 52
  with a boom).
- **Rainbow** *(raids)* — a centered rainbow + sparkles celebration with the
  raider's name and party size. Mirrors the host alert `UI_NewHostAnim`
  ("rainbow" big variant + sparkle/crowd sounds).
- **Banner** — a compact top notification (a clean fallback for any type).

The art is custom inline **SVG** (a cartoon monster, cannon, cash bag, sub
badge, follow heart) tinted to each alert's accent colour, plus a **canvas
particle layer** (coin shower on cheers, confetti on raids, an emote-style
firework on subs, a sparkle ring on follows). The cash bag flies on a real
physics arc and the cannon recoils when it fires.

Each style plays a **built-in synthesized sound** (impact / pop / boom /
fanfare — no files needed); set a Sound URL to override it. Punch/rainbow
subtitles and the cheer bits come straight from the event; the Message field
applies to the banner style.

## Text-to-speech

Subs and bits are spoken aloud by default (toggle "Speak this alert" per type,
and set the phrase in "TTS phrase"). The **Text-to-speech** card picks the
engine:

- **StreamElements** *(default, recommended for OBS)* — plays the voice as an
  MP3 (the classic `Brian` voice by default). Works inside OBS's browser source
  and needs internet on the machine running OBS. The request goes from the
  overlay directly to StreamElements, so it works no matter where the app is
  hosted.
- **Browser voice** — the Web Speech API. Fine in a normal browser but often
  silent inside OBS.
- **Off.**

Cheermote codes (e.g. `cheer100`) are stripped from spoken cheer messages, and
speech is capped at "Max characters".

## Variations, first-chat, goals

These enhance the **modern overlay** (`/overlay.html`):

- **Variations** — per alert, add threshold-based overrides so bigger events
  look bigger. Each line is `min | accent | image | sound | title`; the highest
  matching threshold wins. The `min` compares against bits (cheer), months
  (resub), tier (subs), gift count (gift bomb) or viewers (raid). E.g. a cheer
  variation `1000 | #ffd700 | huge.gif | huge.mp3 | HUGE CHEER!` fires only for
  1000+ bit cheers.
- **Random image/sound** — put several in one field separated by `|`
  (`a.gif | b.gif | c.gif`) and one is picked at random each time.
- **First-time chatter** — a `First Message` alert fires the first time a viewer
  ever chats (off by default; enable it in its card).
- **Returning raiders** — raids from someone who's raided before show
  "Welcome back" instead of "Raid".
- **Goal bars** — add `/goals.html` as its own Browser Source for sub / follower
  progress bars. Counts auto-increment on live events and persist; set the
  target/label and reset the count on the settings page.

## Filtering & anti-spam

Applied before any alert fires (to both overlays), on the settings page:

- **Ignore users** — bots and your own account (a sensible default bot list is
  pre-filled). Ignored events are dropped.
- **Minimum thresholds** — only alert on cheers ≥ N bits or raids ≥ N viewers.
- **Group gift bombs** — a community gift (e.g. 5 subs) arrives as one
  "mystery gift" plus one message per recipient; this collapses them into a
  single "gifted N subs" alert instead of six. On by default.
- **Dedupe** — identical events delivered twice in quick succession are dropped
  automatically.

Dropped events still appear in the Live events monitor with the reason, so
nothing is hidden.

## TTS safety

- **Minimum bits to speak** — read only cheers worth at least N bits.
- **Mask profanity** — common profanity is masked in spoken messages (on by
  default).
- **Muted users** — never speak certain users' messages.
- **Skip current TTS** — a button on the settings page stops whatever's speaking
  right now.

## Live events & testing

The **Live events** panel on the dashboard lists everything the app has
received — subs, cheers, raids, follows — whether or not they fired (skipped
ones are dimmed), with the source (`twitch` / `test` / `replay`). It refreshes
every few seconds, so you can catch an alert you missed or confirm the live
pipeline end-to-end.

Ways to test:

- **Test buttons** (per alert) — fire a fake event through the real overlay
  path. Proves rendering/positioning in OBS.
- **Replay a raw line** — paste a real Twitch IRC `USERNOTICE` line and it runs
  through the *exact* parser and overlay a live event uses. Proves the parsing
  logic against real payloads.
- **Real events** — the ultimate check: a friend/alt follows, or you gift a sub
  / cheer / raid from another account. These flow in over chat/EventSub like any
  live event and show up in the monitor.

## Caching note

The app sends `no-cache` headers for the overlay/settings HTML/JS/CSS, so
updates show up without stale caching. If OBS ever still shows an old version,
right-click the Browser Source → **Refresh**. Fonts and images are cached for a
week (they don't change).

## Design

The overlay's look is taken from the original LachhhTools Flash source
(`LachhhToolsInterfaces.fla`): the dark charcoal glass panel (`#13181B` /
`#1D262C`), the faint teal border (`#80A297`), the mint alert label (`#A2CAB8`)
and near-white name (`#E1F7F1`), and the geometric bold typography. The
original used the commercial *Nexa* font; a close open-source substitute
(Montserrat, OFL) is bundled and self-hosted under `public/fonts`. The elastic
entrance recreates the feel of the original's ActionScript motion effects
(`EffectGotoElastic` / `EffectKickBack` / `EffectSquash`). All colours, text and
timing remain editable per alert on the settings page.

## Password protection

Set the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable to require a login for the
settings dashboard and its config/test/auth APIs. The **overlay URL and its
WebSocket stay open** (unauthenticated) so OBS can always load them.

- **Local:** leave it unset — the app is bound to your machine anyway, so no
  password is needed.
- **Public / Coolify:** set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` so only you can reach the
  dashboard. Anyone with the overlay URL can still display alerts, but they
  can't change your settings or fire tests.

When set, visiting the dashboard shows a login page; a session cookie keeps you
logged in for 30 days, and there's a **Log out** button in the header.

## Configuration

Everything is editable from the settings page. Per alert type you can set:

- Enable/disable
- Title and message text (with tokens — see below)
- On-screen duration
- Accent + text colours
- Image URL (GIF/PNG shown next to the text)
- Sound URL + volume

### Message tokens

Use these in the **Message** field; they're filled in per event:

| Token | Meaning | Available on |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `{name}` | Viewer name (recipient for gifts) | all |
| `{gifter}` | Who gifted | giftsub, giftbomb |
| `{recipient}` | Gift recipient | giftsub |
| `{months}` | Cumulative months | sub, resub, giftsub |
| `{streak}` | Consecutive months | resub |
| `{tier}` | Sub tier (`1`/`2`/`3`/`Prime`) | subs, gifts |
| `{bits}` | Bits cheered | cheer |
| `{viewers}` | Raid party size | raid |
| `{count}` | Number of gifted subs | giftbomb |

Config is stored in `config.json` (git-ignored). `config.example.json` shows the
full shape.

## Follow alerts + reliable events (Twitch login)

Everything works out of the box by reading chat. Connecting your Twitch account
adds two things:

- **Follow alerts** — follows aren't in chat at all, so they *require*
  [EventSub](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/).
- **Reliable subs / resubs / cheers / raids** — once connected, these come over
  EventSub (guaranteed delivery + exact tier/bit/viewer data) instead of being
  read from chat, and the chat reader stops handling them to avoid duplicates.
  **Gifts stay on chat** so recipient names and gift-bomb grouping are kept.

The scopes requested are `moderator:read:followers channel:read:subscriptions
bits:read` (raids need none). Subscriptions you don't grant simply keep coming
from chat. **If you connected before this update, reconnect once** to grant the
new scopes.

This is a one-time setup on the settings page:

1. Go to the [Twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and
   **Register Your Application**.
   - **OAuth Redirect URL:** copy it from the *Follow alerts* card on the
     settings page (the "Copy redirect URL" button). Locally this is
     `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`; on Coolify use your public URL.
   - **Category:** Broadcasting Suite (any is fine).
2. Copy the app's **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**, paste both
   into the *Follow alerts* card, and click **Connect Twitch account**.
3. Authorize with the account you stream from (the `moderator:read:followers`
   scope is requested). You'll be redirected back and the status turns green.

Under the hood the app opens a Twitch EventSub WebSocket, subscribes to
`channel.follow` (v2) plus `channel.subscribe`, `channel.subscription.message`,
`channel.cheer` and `channel.raid`, and refreshes the access token
automatically. If you run
behind a reverse proxy (Coolify), set **Public URL** in that card (or the
`PUBLIC_URL`/`publicUrl` config value) so the OAuth redirect matches what you
registered.

Tokens are stored only in `config.json` (git-ignored) and are never sent back
to the browser.

## How it works

```
Twitch chat (anonymous IRC over WebSocket)
        │  USERNOTICE / PRIVMSG+bits
        ▼
  server/ircParser.js   → normalized alert event
        ▼
  server/index.js       → picks the alert's style block
        │  (gifts → sub style when treatGiftedAsSub is on)
        ▼  WebSocket /ws
  public/overlay.js     → queues + animates one alert at a time  →  OBS
```

- `server/twitchChat.js` — anonymous Twitch chat connection, auto-reconnect.
- `server/ircParser.js` — turns raw IRC lines into alert events.
- `server/index.js` — Express + WebSocket hub, config API, `/api/test`.
- `public/overlay.*` — the OBS browser source.
- `public/settings.*` — the dashboard.
